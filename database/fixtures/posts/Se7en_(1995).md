# Se7en (1995) – Review

[*Se7en* on IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/) | [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_(1995_film))

David Fincher’s *Se7en* is a bleak, relentless thriller that pushes the boundaries of the crime genre. Following detectives Somerset and Mills as they hunt a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi, the film is less about solving a crime than confronting the darkness of human nature.  

The film’s oppressive atmosphere is amplified by its rain-soaked cityscape, giving the setting a timeless, nightmarish quality. Howard Shore’s score and Fincher’s meticulous direction enhance the tension, making every reveal feel like a descent into hell.  

Morgan Freeman’s weary gravitas contrasts with Brad Pitt’s fiery energy, while Kevin Spacey delivers one of cinema’s most chilling villain performances. The infamous climax has become a cultural touchstone—an ending both shocking and inevitable.
