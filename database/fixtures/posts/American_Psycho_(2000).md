# American Psycho (2000) – Review

[*American Psycho* on IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/) | [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_(film))

Mary Harron’s *American Psycho* is a darkly satirical descent into the vanity, excess, and moral bankruptcy of 1980s corporate culture. Adapted from Bret Easton Ellis’ novel, it follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment banker whose polished exterior hides a psychopathic interior.  

Christian Bale delivers a transformative performance, oscillating between chilling detachment and manic absurdity. His Bateman embodies the hollow pursuit of perfection, status, and consumption—rendering him both terrifying and absurdly funny.  

The film’s tonal tightrope—part horror, part comedy—invites viewers to question whether Bateman’s crimes are literal or allegorical. Its commentary on capitalism and identity resonates as strongly today as it did upon release.  

*American Psycho* endures because it provokes: is it about a killer, or is it about the soulless system that produces him? The ambiguity is the point.
