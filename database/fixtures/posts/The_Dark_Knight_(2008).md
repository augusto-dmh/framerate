# The Dark Knight (2008) – Review

[*The Dark Knight* on IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/) | [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film))

Christopher Nolan’s *The Dark Knight* transcends the superhero genre, blending crime epic with philosophical inquiry. Anchored by Christian Bale’s conflicted Batman, the film interrogates the nature of justice, chaos, and moral compromise.  

Heath Ledger’s Joker dominates the screen with a performance that is anarchic, terrifying, and oddly mesmerizing. His embodiment of chaos stands as one of the greatest villain portrayals in film history.  

Nolan’s use of IMAX cameras and practical effects created set pieces—like the truck flip—that set a new bar for cinematic spectacle. Yet beneath the action lies a story of ethical dilemmas, where every character must confront the cost of their choices.  

*The Dark Knight* is as much about Gotham’s soul as it is about its hero. In pushing Batman to his limits, the film redefined what a comic book adaptation could achieve.
